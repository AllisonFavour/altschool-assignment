          A short biography.
        </h1>
        <p>
          In the cold morning of August 3rd, 1997 I arrived.
          I was told that the great legendary afrobeat pioneer &lpar;Fela Kuti&rpar; passed away just few hours before my birth time, RIP to the legend.
        </p>
         <p>
          Back to my story, with tears of joy filled in both parents eye they decided to name me Favour, considering my birth as God's favour to them.
         </p>
         <p>
          I come from a family of six including parents, two elder brothers and an elder sister which means i am the last born of the family. Both parent of ours came from Kogi state but i was born and brought up in Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos Nigeria. You are free to call me a (full blooded) Kogi boy as some might say despite being raised in Lagos and not being able to speak my native language.
         </p>
         <p>
          I attended highly favored nursery and primary school, starting directly from primary after being home schooled and attending kids lesson then i graduated to Oshodi High School where i completed my junior and secondary school learning.
         </p>
         <p>I used to love dancing a lot since i was a little kid and i got tipped from audience watching me entertain them, so i joined a dancing crew but i couldn't continue with the crew cause the billd had to be paid as we were not finacially buoyant but we mainted to keep a positively calm demeanor.</p>
         <p>
          Started fending for myself very early on with little to no support from parents not because they did not want to but because they could not.
         </p>
         <p>
          During my junior school graduation holiday before proceeding to secondary school, i spent my holiday learning how to make leather slips and shoes, eventually had to stop cause my boss wasnt too willing to teach me what i came to learn but i was stil able to make some sandals and slips after i left with the little i was able to learn coupled with my imagination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Few months after graduating secondary school, i had an opportunity to work as a clear at a UBA bank branch. I worked there for two years while assisting the bankers to get food, help them sort out some little errands aroud the bank and somtimes outside, also assisting the branch admin to get work done occasionally when his hands are full.
          </p>
          <p>
            While working i wrote jamb exam twice but was not lucky prepared enough to be admitted into Unilag then i decided to go into clothing cause i have always felt deeply i had an intuitive sense of fashion style especially in urban wears.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name of my fashion brand is Trillest Wears, i am partially into music production and i have made couple of songs which are on <a href="https://audiomack.com/trillestojay">Audiomack</a> and <a href="https://music.apple.com/ng/artist/trillest-ojay/1552286970">Apple music</a>, my artist name is Trillest Ojay.
